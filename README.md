# Project Happy Thoughts API
This weeks project was about building our own API which includes both GET request endpoints to return data and POST endpoints to create data using Express and MongoDB. 
The API should implement the routes
Validate user input and return appropriate errors if the input is invalid.
Create a new thought which is connected to a previous project for the Frontend called project-happy-thought. 

## The problem
My main issue with the backend is being able to check if it works and reading the error messages, knowing when Postman should be used and Compass. I also find it consuming fully grasping Atlas and Cloude but a bit clearer after this project. But mostly if the code and the API is communicating or not is my main challenge to figure out as I code and work on the project.
